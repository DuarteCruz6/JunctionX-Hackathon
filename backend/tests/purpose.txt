This folder will contain all the tests for testing our Backend (if we have enough time to create)

ChatGPT:

    Purpose: Test your FastAPI endpoints, business logic, ML integration, and async tasks.

    Examples:
        test_routes.py → check if endpoints return the correct status and response.
        test_ml_model.py → verify the Hugging Face model API call returns expected outputs.
        test_tasks.py → check Celery tasks run correctly.
        test_utils.py → test helper functions.

    Tools: pytest is the most common for Python.
